    "text": "Inspired by Danny Cunningham’s article SUVs are Killing People, this notebook aims to investigate accidents involving cars and pedestrians in the state of Victoria, Australia. The key question this notebook aims to investigate is: What is the injury risk that different types of common passenger vehicles have on pedestrians in car accidents?\nThe Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI) reports a uptrend of larger passenger vehicle sales in Australia. The latest March 2023 report demonstrates this with SUV & light commercial vehicles sales far outweighing passenger vehicle sales. The Guardian also has a great visual showing the trend over the years. The Toyota Hilux (a utility vehicle) is currently the highest selling model according to the FCAI March 2023 report, followed by the Ford Ranger (utility vehicle) and the Isuzu D-Max (utility vehicle).\nPublic data on Victorian car accidents can be found on VicRoads and from Data Vic\nLoading & cleaning the crash data\nWe first load in the three relevant tables from the Data Vic Crash Stats dataset: Accident, Person & Vehicle. The crash statistics data ranges from January 2006 to October 2020.\nWe will only look at car accidents involving pedestrians and cars that are labelled as ‘cars’, ‘station wagons’ and ‘utility’. The data also filters for accidents with a speed limit of 110 and below to rule out data entry errors.\nAs many vehicles are labelled differently as cars, station wagons or utility trucks, we will categorize the same make & model based on the most frequent label. E.g. The Toyota Hilux is labelled as a car, station wagon and utility vehicle in the vehicle table depending on the individual crash id. Since it is labelled as a utility vehicle more often, we will categorise it as a utility vehicle.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\naccident <- read_csv(\"ACCIDENT.csv\") %>% \n  select(-c(DIRECTORY, EDITION, PAGE, \n            GRID_REFERENCE_X, GRID_REFERENCE_Y, NODE_ID)) %>%\n  mutate(ACCIDENTDATE = lubridate::dmy(ACCIDENTDATE), # Parsing dates\n         SPEED_ZONE = as.numeric(SPEED_ZONE)) \n\nperson <- read_csv(\"PERSON.csv\") %>%\n  select(-c(VEHICLE_ID, SEATING_POSITION, HELMET_BELT_WORN, EJECTED_CODE)) %>%\n  filter(ROAD_USER_TYPE == 1) # 1 being pedestrians\n\nvehicle <- read_csv(\"VEHICLE.csv\") %>%\n  select(-c(INITIAL_DIRECTION, CONSTRUCTION_TYPE, FUEL_TYPE, FINAL_DIRECTION, TRAILER_TYPE,\n            VEHICLE_COLOUR_1, VEHICLE_COLOUR_2, CAUGHT_FIRE, LAMPS, OWNER_POSTCODE, TOWED_AWAY_FLAG)) %>%\n  mutate(Make_Model = paste(gsub(\" \", \"\", VEHICLE_MAKE), VEHICLE_MODEL))\n\n# List of Vehicles of interest\nveh_interest <- list('Car', 'Station Wagon', 'Utility')\n\n# Creating a combined table from accident, person, vehicle\npedestrians <- left_join(accident, person, by = 'ACCIDENT_NO') %>%\n  left_join(., vehicle, by = 'ACCIDENT_NO') %>%\n  filter(ACCIDENT_TYPE == 2,  # 2 being struck pedestrians\n         `Vehicle Type Desc` %in% veh_interest,\n         SPEED_ZONE <= 110) \n\n# pedestrian d.f but with Vehicle Type Desc based on frequency of occurence\np_recat <- pedestrians %>% \n      add_count(Make_Model, `Vehicle Type Desc`) %>%\n      group_by(Make_Model) %>%\n      mutate(`Vehicle Type Desc` = `Vehicle Type Desc`[which.max(n)]) %>%\n      ungroup() %>%\n      select(-n)\n\np_recat\n\n# A tibble: 15,101 × 61\n   ACCIDENT…¹ ACCIDENT…² ACCID…³ ACCID…⁴ Accid…⁵ DAY_O…⁶ Day W…⁷ DCA_C…⁸ DCA D…⁹\n   <chr>      <date>     <time>    <dbl> <chr>     <dbl> <chr>     <dbl> <chr>  \n 1 T20060000… 2006-01-16 11:00         2 Struck…       2 Monday      109 ANY MA…\n 2 T20060000… 2006-01-17 04:30         2 Struck…       3 Tuesday     104 PED WA…\n 3 T20060000… 2006-01-20 13:00         2 Struck…       6 Friday      100 PED NE…\n 4 T20060000… 2006-01-27 14:10         2 Struck…       6 Friday      100 PED NE…\n 5 T20060000… 2006-01-27 15:40         2 Struck…       6 Friday      100 PED NE…\n 6 T20060000… 2006-01-27 15:47         2 Struck…       6 Friday      109 ANY MA…\n 7 T20060000… 2006-01-29 15:53         2 Struck…       1 Sunday      100 PED NE…\n 8 T20060000… 2006-01-29 15:53         2 Struck…       1 Sunday      100 PED NE…\n 9 T20060000… 2006-02-03 07:40         2 Struck…       6 Friday      100 PED NE…\n10 T20060001… 2006-02-01 12:30         2 Struck…       4 Wednes…     100 PED NE…\n# … with 15,091 more rows, 52 more variables: LIGHT_CONDITION <dbl>,\n#   `Light Condition Desc` <chr>, NO_OF_VEHICLES <dbl>, NO_PERSONS <dbl>,\n#   NO_PERSONS_INJ_2 <dbl>, NO_PERSONS_INJ_3 <dbl>, NO_PERSONS_KILLED <dbl>,\n#   NO_PERSONS_NOT_INJ <dbl>, POLICE_ATTEND <dbl>, ROAD_GEOMETRY <dbl>,\n#   `Road Geometry Desc` <chr>, SEVERITY <dbl>, SPEED_ZONE <dbl>,\n#   PERSON_ID <chr>, SEX <chr>, AGE <dbl>, `Age Group` <chr>, INJ_LEVEL <dbl>,\n#   `Inj Level Desc` <chr>, ROAD_USER_TYPE <dbl>, …\n\n\nA quick look at the vehicle make/model and its categorisation:\n\nlibrary(reactable)\n\nmake_model <- p_recat %>% group_by(Make_Model, `Vehicle Type Desc`) %>% \n       summarise(n = n()) %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% \n       pivot_wider(names_from = `Vehicle Type Desc`, values_from = n)\n\nreactable::reactable(make_model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring the data\nVehicle accidents involving pedestrians occur with vehicles labelled as cars more frequently.

The linear model estimates that utility vehicles add an additional 1.68% risk of fatality to pedestrians compared to the other vehicles observed. The effect of station wagons is positive towards fatalities albeit not significant, thus it is inconclusive whether station wagons have any effect of pedestrian fatalities compared to cars.\nTo see the make and models of station wagons/utility vehicles, please refer to the make and model table above in which you are able to sort for station wagons/utility vehicle by clicking on the column headers.\nThe model also estimates a positive significant effect of the speed zone (speed limit) on fatalities.\nPedestrian serious injuries:\nThe linear regression estimates that both station wagons and utility vehicles have a positive effect on serious injuries but these effects are not significant.\nSimilarly to the fatality model, this model also estimates significant positive effects on the speed zone on fatalities.\nSummary\nThe linear model estimates utility vehicles increase the risk of fatality by 1.68% compared to other vehicles observed, which may seem small, however when we see the shift towards larger vehicles in Australia (the top 3 best selling vehicles are utility vehicles), it may result in more pedestrian deaths.\nThe data currently has cars outweighing utility vehicles & station wagons in the number of accidents involving pedestrians. However we may see this shift to larger vehicles being more frequently involved in pedestrian accidents.\nCould the shift in consumer demand towards larger vehicles sacrifice pedestrian safety for driver/passenger safety in Victoria?\nKey Constraint:\nVehicle descriptions are reliant on data inputted in the individual crash report. This may mean vehicles descriptions may vary across different reports and also vehicle descriptions evolve over time due to shifts in the car industry (e.g. Station Wagons in the 2000s may refer to cars more like the Holden Commodore Wagon, where as in the 2010s it may refer to cars more like Toyota RAV 4)."
